## 2. Problem Context

| Element | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Challenge** | Inefficient space allocation in unattended lockers and last-mile routes |
| **Opportunity** | AI-driven prediction of parcel size, route density, and access frequency |
| **Business Link** | Core use case in TCNS digital valorization of logistics data |

---

## 3. AI Approach

| Layer | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧩 **Data Layer** | Parcel metadata, delivery timestamps, and spatial coordinates |
| ⚙️ **Model Layer** | K-means clustering for space grouping and regression for capacity prediction |
| 🛰️ **API Layer** | Azure ML endpoint secured via TCNS Auth middleware |
| 📊 **Visualization Layer** | Power BI / React dashboard sketch for route-level decision display |

---

## 4. Results & Learnings
- 🚀 25–30 % improved space efficiency  
- 🎯 > 90 % precision in frequency-based locker allocation  
- 🔁 Need for **model-drift monitoring** due to seasonal delivery fluctuations  

---

## 5. Next Steps
- Integrate **predictive auto-routing**  
- Connect **digital lock telemetry**  
- Add **multilingual UX interface** (Winter Release 2025)

---

## 6. Reflection
This case demonstrates how **AI engineering** transforms everyday logistics performance through  
secure data interoperability and digital valorization — aligning physical operations with TCNS’s data-driven vision.
