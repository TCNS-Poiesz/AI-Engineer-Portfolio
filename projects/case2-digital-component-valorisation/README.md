# Case 2 â€” Digital Component Valorisation (DCV)

**Goal:** Demonstrate how data analysis and insights can unlock digital value in the agri-food chain.  

## Steps
1. Collect microbiome / process data (soil, grass, milk, cheese).  
2. Perform DNA NGS analysis and survival testing (e.g. TIM technology).  
3. Analyze digital attributes across the chain (sustainability, traceability, health impact).  
4. Build dashboards to show product attributes and valorisation metrics.  

## Data
- Mock data or anonymized datasets go here.  
- Example: `soil_microbiome.csv`, `milk_quality.csv`.
