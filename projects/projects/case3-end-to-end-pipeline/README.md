# Case 3 â€” End-to-End Pipeline Deployment

**Goal:** Deploy an AI pipeline with API + dashboard integration for real-time insights.

## Steps
1. Train a machine learning model (e.g. FastAPI backend).  
2. Build an API endpoint to serve predictions.  
3. Create a Streamlit dashboard to visualize results interactively.  
4. Deploy pipeline (e.g. Docker or cloud platform).  

## Data
- Sample dataset (mock or anonymized).  
- Example: `transactions.csv` with features + labels.
